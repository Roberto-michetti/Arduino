  Back-and-Forth LED Chaser Program
  This program creates a back-and-forth (ping-pong) chaser effect using three LEDs connected to digital pins 9, 8, and 7 on an Arduino.
  The LEDs turn on one by one in a forward sequence, then turn off in the same order. After that, the LEDs turn on and off in reverse order.
  
  Type: Digital output control
  Goal: Sequentially turn on and off LEDs to create a back-and-forth chasing light effect.
