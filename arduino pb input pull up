  Pushbutton State Display Program
  This program uses a pushbutton connected to digital pin 2 with an internal pull-up resistor.
  It reads the state of the pushbutton (HIGH or LOW) and displays the state on the Serial Monitor.
  When the button is released, it reads HIGH (1), and when pressed, it reads LOW (0).
  
  Type: Digital input reading with Serial output
  Goal: Display the state of the pushbutton on the Serial Monitor.

// Define the pin number where the pushbutton is connected
const int pushButton = 2;  // Assign pin 2 to pushButton
void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);                // Initialize serial communication at 9600 baud for the Serial Monitor
  pinMode(pushButton, INPUT_PULLUP); // Set pushButton as an input with an internal pull-up resistor enabled
}
void loop() {
  int buttonState = digitalRead(pushButton); // Read the current state of the pushbutton (HIGH or LOW)
  
  Serial.print("buttonState = ");            // Print label for button state to the Serial Monitor
  Serial.println(buttonState);               // Print the current button state (1 for HIGH, 0 for LOW)
  
  delay(10);                                 // Small delay to stabilize the reading
