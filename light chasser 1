  LED Chaser Program
  This program creates a simple chaser effect using three LEDs connected to digital pins 9, 8, and 7 on an Arduino.
  The LEDs turn on one by one with a delay in between, and then turn off in the same sequence.
  
  Type: Digital output control
  Goal: Sequentially turn on and off LEDs to create a chasing light effect.
